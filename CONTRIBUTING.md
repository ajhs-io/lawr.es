# :construction: Contribution

If you want to contribute to the project please open a [ticket](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/issues) first and 
describe what you want to do or what your idea is. Maybe there already is an existing ticket for your or a very similar 
topic.

I may decline contributions for features that may not fit into the application, so make sure to talk to me before
starting to code.

## Contribution Guidelines

* Always use the `dev` branch to work on the application. The dev branch will contain the latest version of the app
  while the `master` branch may contains the stable version (which may be outdated in terms of development).
* Consider using a separate branch if you are working on a larger feature.
* Reference the issue number in your commits please.
* When opening a pull request, link to your ticket and describe what you did to solve the problem.
