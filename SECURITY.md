# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As LinkAce is currently being developed, there is no support for the current releases. All releases are marked
as pre-releases, and a development disclaimer is present in the README. Usage of the app in this state is entirely
on your own risk.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.x     | :x:                |
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |

### Support for PHP versions

The PHP version supported by LinkAce is the oldest version of PHP that is still **officially supported** in terms of
security fixes. You can check the currently supported versions on [php.net](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php).


## Reporting a Vulnerability

All dependencies are updated regularly, security fixes for those dependencies are released as fast as possible.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact me directly via `contact [at] linkace [dot] org`. Those
vulnerabilities are addressed as fast as possible.

At the moment, there is no bug bounty program active.
